Paper: Toward Deep Reinforcement Learning without a Simulator: An Autonomous Steering Example

Test Environment Game: Assetto Corsa

1. Purchase Game
2. Python script to capture screenshots at a reasonable framerate
3. Apply deep neural networks for:
	Imitation Learning
	Reinforcement Learning
	Deep Reward Induction		***An algorithm proposed by the paper
	DDQN
4. Run ‭vision analysis with GPU on the cloud (AWS)? -> May be able to do on computer, albeit slow

Environmental Variables in Assetto Corsa:
- Lotus Elise SC car model
- Eliminate accelerator/brake control variability by using cruise control
- Speed set to 50 kmh
